# ‚ö° Quasi-Dynamic Load Flow for Distribution Systems

## üß™ General Description

This simulation environment allows the analysis of the electrical behavior of three-phase distribution systems using load flow algorithms and quasi-dynamic simulations. The models enable:

- Representation of real-world networks, including urban European systems and German rural grids.
- Evaluation of various numerical methods, including:
  - Newton's method in the real domain.
  - Newton's method in the complex domain using Wirtinger calculus and a fixed-point method to solve the non-holomorphic complex linear system (Proposed Method).
  - Backward/Forward sweep algorithm (for radial systems).
  - Direct fixed-point method.
- Hourly behavior simulation of the grid (24-hour horizon) with variable load profiles.
- Comparison of accuracy, stability, and computational performance among the methods.

This set of tools is aimed at research and analysis of modern and active electrical distribution systems.
